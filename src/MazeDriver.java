// * This program simulates a robot getting through a maze.
// *	Unlike tic-tac-toe, where the user is the player, the robot moves
// autonomously through the maze.
// * 	We intentionally share the memory location of the maze with the robot.
// Otherwise the robot would not know how to plan and make its moves.
//
// The maze is stored in a text file that will be entered at runtime.
// The layout of each maze file will contain:
// �	In the first line:  two integers (the number of rows and columns, respectively,  in the maze)
// �	In the second line:  two integers (the row and column locations, respectively, of the Start cell
// �	In the third line:  two integers (the row and column locations, respectively, of the Exit cell
// �	Each line thereafter will contain characters appearing in one row of the maze.
